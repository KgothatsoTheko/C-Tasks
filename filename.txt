 development using Kotlin or cross platforms like Ionic/React Native.
 My journey includes completing a Higher Certificate in Information

 Services, focusing on modern web development practices, cloud
 technologies, and industry standards. My technical expertise spans
 JavaScript, Kotlin, C#, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React, and
 Android Studio, and I continuously strive to stay updated with the
 latest advancements in the tech space.
 I thrive on solving problems through code and have a Kaizen
 mindset, always seeking to improve and optimize my solutions.
 I'm excited to collaborate with innovative teams and contribute to
 projects that make a meaningful impact.
Interests:
 • Problem-solving through coding
 • Continuous learning and innovation
 • Exploring emerging technologies like AI/ML, IoT and cloud
